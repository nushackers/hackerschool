  audience:
    Basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter is required. Some background in calculus

  description:
    In this workshop, we will learn about the keys ideas of MCMC, bits of mathematical theory, and its applications
    and implementations, including variants such as Random Walk Metropolis and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

    Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were invented around the time of World War II by several mathematicians and
    physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project. What started out as a way to solve high-dimensional integrals from chemical
    physics is now a general, powerful approach to generate samples from probability distributions. It is widely applied in statistics,
    computations for the natural sciences, and more recently machine learning and data science. Regarded as one of the top 10 most
    important algorithms in the 20th century, MCMC is undoubtedly an essential tool in any scientist’s technical repertoire.

    This workshop was inspired by <a href='https://hacker-tools.github.io/' target="_blank">hacker-tools</a>.
    As hackers, we spend a lot of time on our computers, so it makes sense to make that experience as fluid and frictionless as possible.
    <br>We continue from last week by first discussing some small topics including improving your web browsing experience, the security and privacy of your digital life, and working and accessing computers remotely when away or on-the-go across Windows and Unix.
    <br>Next, we explore how to look at what is happening on a system or in an application, so you can diagnose and fix a broken system or application, including some networking issues.
    <br>Finally, we touch briefly on Linux containers and how it can be useful when developing programs.
    <br>Please come prepared with a Linux environment installed (macOS or Windows Subsystem for Linux is NOT sufficient!). If you do not currently have one, we recommend installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox. Applications from the following Ubuntu packages will be used
    <b>openssh-client mosh sshfs freerdp2-x11 gdb strace ltrace time linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic htop dstat iproute2 dnsutils traceroute tracepath</b>
